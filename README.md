# X509CertificateCryptor
A Powershell script to encrypt and decrypt files in a folder using x509 public certificate to encrypt and private key to decrypt files
You need to make your own x509 keypair (best choice for me seems openSSL): 
Use the following command to generate: openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365


The original script was written by Ryan Ries - ryan@myotherpcisacloud.com

I just gonna extend it to more files within a folder and a range of file extensions
